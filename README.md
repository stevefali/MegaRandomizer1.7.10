# Mega Randomizer 1.7.10

This is the 1.7.10 version of my [Mega Randomizer](https://github.com/stevefali/MegaRandomizer) Minecraft mod.

This mod comes with custom game rules that allow you to individually turn on or off item drop randomization for
Blocks, Entities or Players. (More to come in future versions!)
